Introduction to the Ostro |trade| Project
#########################################

The Ostro |trade| OS is a scalable open source operating system tailored
specifically for IoT smart devices. Out of the box, we provide an
OS developer image ready to install on a USB stick or SD card, boot, and then 
use to learn about the Ostro OS.  With this developer image you can build and test 
applications written for the Ostro OS, and then later build a clean production image 
for deploying on your devices. 

The Ostro OS maximizes the connectivity potential of your devices,
and will have a suite of powerful development tools to let you add and
configure more features easily. It provides you the capability to manage the
multitudes of devices in your ecosystem and most importantly, it keeps your
whole IoT world secure.
