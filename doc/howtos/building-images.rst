Building Ostro |trade| OS Images
################################

This technical note describes the basic instructions for building an Ostro |trade| OS image
from source using the Yocto Project tools.  You should already be familiar with these Yocto
Project tools, as explained in the `Yocto Project Quick Start Guide`_. 

.. _`Yocto Project Quick Start Guide`: http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html

Initial Steps
=============

1. Check out the ``ostro-os`` repository from the ``ostroproject`` GitHub area.  This will retrieve the Ostro OS source code
   and necessary Yocto Project tools and configuration files. The Ostro OS code is a combination of
   several different components in a single repository.  (See the README in the cloned copy you just made 
   for up-to-date details on what’s included.)
2. In the repository, run :command:`source oe-init-build-env` to setup the Yocto Project build environment.
3. Update the :file:`conf/local.conf` configuration file (more details about this in the sections below)
4. Generate an Ostro OS image using :command:`bitbake ostro-image` (additional build target options are explained
   in the sections below.)
5. Install and boot as described in the :ref:`booting-and-installation` tech note.

Depending on your development machine’s performance, building an image from source 
(the :command:`bitbake ostro-image` command) may take a few hours to complete the first time. 
It will download and compile all 
the source code needed to create the binary image, including the Linux kernel, 
compiler tools, upstream components and Ostro OS-specific patches.  (If you haven't 
done so yet, this might be a good time to read through 
the `Yocto Project Quick Start Guide`_.)

When the build process completes, the generated image will be in the folder 
:file:`build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/$(MACHINE)`
       
If errors occur during the build, refer to the `Yocto Project Errors and Warnings`_ documentation to help 
resolve the issues and repeat the :command:`bitbake ostro-image` command to continue.

Image Configuration
===================

Building images depends on choosing the private keys that are needed
during the build process. One either has to generate and configure
these keys or disable the features which depend on them.

In addition, images are locked down by default: for example, none of
the existing user accounts (including root) has a password set, so
logging into the running system is impossible. Some way of interacting
with the system after booting it has to be chosen before building
images.

Target MACHINE Architecture
----------------------------

The build's default target architecture ``MACHINE`` is ``intel-corei7-64``, 
as configured in :file:`build/conf/local.conf`. 
You can edit the :file:`local.conf` file to change this to a different machine appropriate for your platform. 

For currently :ref:`platforms`, the appropriate ``MACHINE`` selections are:

.. table:: Yocto MACHINE selection for Supported Hardware platforms

    ============  ====================================
    Platform      Yocto Project MACHINE selection
    ============  ====================================
    GigaByte      intel-corei7-64
    Galileo       intel-quark
    MinnowBoard   intel-corei7-64
    Edison        edison
    ============  ====================================

Virtual machine images (a :file:`.vdi` file) are created for each of these builds hardware platforms as part 
of the build process (and included in the prebuilt image folders too).

Base Images
-----------

``ostro-image.bb`` is the image recipe used by the Ostro
project. It uses image features (configured via ``IMAGE_FEATURES``) to
control the content and the image configuration.

Internally, several virtual image variants are created from that base
recipe. They differ in the set of image features added or removed
from the base recipe:

ostro-image:
    The default image. Contains all programming runtimes.

ostro-image-dev:
    The same as ostro-image, plus build and debugging tools.

ostro-image-minimal:
    A smaller image which still has the core OS, but none of the
    optional runtimes.

Additional image variants can be defined in the ``local.conf``. For
example, the following adds ``ostro-image-noima`` and
``ostro-image-dev-noima`` as build targets where IMA is disabled and thus
no IMA keys are needed::

    OSTRO_EXTRA_IMAGE_VARIANTS = "imagevariant:noima imagevariant:dev,noima"


Image Formats
-------------

It is possible to produce different types of images:

.dsk:
    The basic format, which can be written to a block device with "dd".

.dsk.vdi:
    VirtualBox format, for running OSTRO inside a Virtual Machine.

compressed formats:
    Same as above, only compressed, to reduce (final) space occupation
    and speed up the transfer between systems of the Ostro OS image.
    Notice that the creation of compressed images will require additional
    temporary space, because the creation of the compressed image depends
    on the presence of the uncompressed one.

To customize the image format, modify ``local.conf``, adding the variable
``OSTRO_VM_IMAGE_TYPES``, set to any combination of the following::

    dsk dsk_xz dsk.vdi dsk.vdi_xz

It will also trigger the creation of corresponding symlinks.

Example::

    OSTRO_VM_IMAGE_TYPES = "dsk_xz dsk.vdi_xz"

will create both the raw and the VirtualBox images, both compressed.



Development Images
------------------

All images provided by the Ostro Project are targetting
developers. Because the project wants to avoid having developers
accidentally build images for real products that have development
features enabled, explicit changes in ``local.conf`` are needed to
enable them.

Developers building their own images for personal use can follow these
instructions to replicate the published Ostro OS images. All necessary
private keys are provided in the ``ostro-os`` repository.

To do this, before building,  edit the :file:`conf/local.conf` configuration file, 
find the line
with ``# require conf/distro/include/ostro-os-development.inc`` and
uncomment it.


Production Images
-----------------

When building production images, first follow the instructions
provided in :file:`meta-integrity/doc/README.md` for creating your own
keys. Then edit the :file:`conf/local.conf` configuration file and
set ``IMA_EVM_KEY_DIR`` to the directory containing
these keys or set the individual variables for each required
key (see ``ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass``).

In addition, find the line
with ``# require conf/distro/include/ostro-os-production.inc`` and
uncomment it. This documents that the intention really is to build
production images and disables a sanity check that would otherwise
abort a build.

Then add your custom applications and services by listing them as
additional packages as described in the next section.


Installing Additional Packages
------------------------------

Extend ``OSTRO_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL`` to install additional packages
into all Ostro OS image variants, for example with::

    OSTRO_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "strace"

It is possible to limit the change to specific images. Let's assume
for example that you want to add strace to your development image (and
only that one), here is how you can proceed::

    OSTRO_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL_append_pn-ostro-image-dev = " strace"

Beware of the leading space, it is needed when using ``_append``.

This example assumes that :command:`bitbake ostro-image-dev` is used to build
an image. By making the append conditional on the name of the image,
different images can be built with different content inside the same
build configuration.

Alternatively, ``CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL`` can also be used. The
difference is that this will also affect the initramfs images, which is
often not intended.
