# When building in a CI system with swupd enabled, OS_VERSION must be

# seconds.
#
# The default behavior is to not rebuild just because OS_VERSION
# changed. If that is desired, include in local.conf:
#   VERSION_ID = "${OS_VERSION}"
# This will cause the os-release package to be rebuilt each time
# OS_VERSION changes, and that in turn causes an image and bundle
# rebuild.
#
# For more predictable results is possible to set OS_RELEASE manually,
# either in local.conf or in the environment like this:
#   BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE="$BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE OS_VERSION" OS_VERSION=110 bitbake ...

# Ostro OS tries to build minimal images and thus prefers Busybox or
# Toybox over coreutils or any other package providing similar
# functionality. For technical reasons, this is crucial when building
# swupd bundles: Busybox/Toybox must be picked consistently, even when
# a bundle pulls in alternatives like coreutils which normally would
# have a higher priority.
#
# This gets achieved in two ways:
# 1. via ostro-update-alternatives.bbclass we modify all packages
#    so that their update-alternatives priority can be modified
#    during install time
# 2. in ostro-image.bbclass we reconfigure those priorities
#    as necessary
#
# This is still a change that is done consistently for all images,
# whether they use swupd or not, to ensure that the result is
# identical. Doing it at image creation time reduces the need
# for recompilations of packages and opens up the possibility
# for downstream developers to override the defaults while
# reusing pre-compiled binaries from our sstate.
