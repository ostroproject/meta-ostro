# To find such files, boot a signed image with no_ima, then run:
# cd /
# find etc usr -type f |
# while read i; do
#    ima=$(getfattr -d -e hex -m security.ima "$i" | grep security.ima)

# Files which get modified during booting will show up as "broken"
# or "unprotected".
#
# At the moment, Ostro OS sets up IMA so that everything must be either
# signed (thus becoming read-only) or hashed (writeable because the
# kernel will updated hashes). Everything under /etc, /var, /home and /usr/dbspace
# is writable. That policy gets loaded in the initramfs, see
# core-image-minimal-initramfs.bbappend.
#
# Common pitfalls:
# - After booting without IMA, enabling IMA again may run into problems
#   because files were modified without updating the hash. This can be
#   done manually with "evmctl ima_hash <file>".
# - rootfs must be mounted with "i_version" (see ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass for
#   more information). This is done via the "rootflags" boot parameter
#   (via APPEND) because only remounting like that via fstab is problematic
#   for those files written by systemd before remounting (/etc/machine-id!).
#   In addition, ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass also adds the parameter to the rootfs
#   because otherwise systemd would remove it.
# - When image signing is disabled, we must not load the IMA policy.
#   Alternatively, we could add a ostro-initramfs-noima, but the
#   benefits of that (smaller initramfs) do not justify the downsides
#   (building becomes slower).
