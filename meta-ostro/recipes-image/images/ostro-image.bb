# Exception for /usr/dbspace/.security-manager.db: we set the owner

# measuring/appraising files owned by root.
#
# SecurityManager is unaware of the change and does not need to
# care, because it runs as root and can thus still use the file.
# The file never gets removed either, so the change is permanent.
#
# That is necessary because IMA and sqlite do not play
# well together ("[Linux-ima-user] IMA hash update"). The problem
# is that the IMA hash only gets updated on close(), but sqlite
# and SecurityManager keep the file open unless SecurityManager shuts
# down. So a power loss after a write leads to an incorrect IMA hash
# and makes the .db file unusable.
#
# However, the .db.journal files still get created as root (and thus
# are owned by root) and suffer from the same risk. Both a setuid bit
# on the directory (not supported by Linux, only BSD) or gid support
# in IMA together with setgid (not in upstream kernel) would help, but
# as that doesn't work we have to accept a certain risk of corruption
# during the much smaller time window where these .db.journal files
# exist.
#
# Long term the right solution will be to limit IMA to the read-only
# rootfs and put all writeable files in a different partition.

#
# To find such files, boot a signed image with no_ima, then run:
# cd /
# find etc usr -type f |
# while read i; do
#    ima=$(getfattr -d -e hex -m security.ima "$i" | grep security.ima)

# Files which get modified during booting will show up as "broken"
# or "unprotected".
#
# At the moment, Ostro OS sets up IMA so that everything must be either
# signed (thus becoming read-only) or hashed (writeable because the
# kernel will updated hashes). Everything under /etc, /var, /home and /usr/dbspace
# is writable. That policy gets loaded in the initramfs, see
# core-image-minimal-initramfs.bbappend.
#
# Common pitfalls:
# - After booting without IMA, enabling IMA again may run into problems
#   because files were modified without updating the hash. This can be
#   done manually with "evmctl ima_hash <file>".
# - rootfs must be mounted with "i_version" (see ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass for
#   more information). This is done via the "rootflags" boot parameter
#   (via APPEND) because only remounting like that via fstab is problematic
#   for those files written by systemd before remounting (/etc/machine-id!).
#   In addition, ima-evm-rootfs.bbclass also adds the parameter to the rootfs
#   because otherwise systemd would remove it.
# - When image signing is disabled, we must not load the IMA policy.
#   Alternatively, we could add a ostro-initramfs-noima, but the
#   benefits of that (smaller initramfs) do not justify the downsides
#   (building becomes slower).
